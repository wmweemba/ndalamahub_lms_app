FILE EDITING TROUBLESHOOTING LOG - VS Code AI Assistant
Date: August 29, 2025
Session Summary: Issues with replace_string_in_file and create_file tools

=== PROBLEM DESCRIPTION ===
User reported that file changes made by AI assistant were not being reflected in the actual project files.
Specifically observed when trying to implement loan disbursement permission changes.

=== TOOLS TESTED ===

1. replace_string_in_file tool:
   - Attempted to modify changelog.md multiple times
   - Tool reported "successfully edited" but changes were not persisted
   - Tried different approaches with more/less context
   - No syntax errors in replacements
   - File timestamps showed no recent updates

2. create_file tool:
   - Attempted to create test_file.txt
   - Tool reported success but file was created empty
   - No content was written despite providing content parameter

3. Terminal commands (SUCCESSFUL):
   - Used PowerShell echo command to append to files
   - Successfully added content to both test_file.txt and changelog.md
   - Changes were immediately visible and persisted
   - File timestamps updated correctly

=== ATTEMPTED CHANGES ===
Originally trying to implement:
- server/routes/loans.js: Change disbursement endpoint from authorize('corporate_admin', 'client_admin') to authorize('lender_admin')
- client/src/utils/roleUtils.js: Add canDisburseLoan() function
- client/src/components/loans/LoanDetailsDialog.jsx: Update permission checks for disburse button

=== SUCCESSFUL WORKAROUND ===
Terminal commands work for file modifications:
- echo "content" >> filename (append)
- Get-Content filename (read)
- Set-Content filename "content" (overwrite)

=== SYMPTOMS ===
- File editing tools report success but no actual file changes
- No error messages or permission denied errors
- Terminal file operations work normally
- File permissions appear normal (Mode: -a----)
- Files are not locked or in use by other processes

=== ENVIRONMENT ===
- OS: Windows
- Shell: PowerShell
- Editor: VS Code
- Working Directory: C:\Dev_Projects\ndalamahub_LMS_app
- File being modified: changelog.md (24917 bytes)

=== POTENTIAL CAUSES TO INVESTIGATE ===
1. VS Code extension/plugin interference
2. File system permissions or security software
3. VS Code workspace settings or file watchers
4. Temporary file handling issues
5. Unicode/encoding problems
6. VS Code auto-save or file sync conflicts
7. Windows Defender or antivirus file protection
8. WSL/Virtual environment file system issues
9. VS Code API rate limiting or tool restrictions
10. File caching or buffering delays

=== NEXT STEPS ===
User wants to research this issue online before proceeding with workarounds.
